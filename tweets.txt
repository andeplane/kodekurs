@BarackObama has sold guns to Mexican drug lords while his DOJ erodes our 2nd  Amendment rights.
Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE!
The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal.
While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy  our credit, our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure---as a President.
Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly.
Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency. His record proves it.

Oil is starting to rise again despite the horrible times. OPEC continues to rip us off. Not worth $30. New leadership needed.
The Fed continues to flood the market with US dollars. Wrong move.
Looking forward to the GOP  debate and the outcome of the Ames straw poll. We must get a real leader.
How will Mitt Romney defend his  record on jobs and Romneycare in tonight's debate?
It's easy to see why Americans are sick of career politicians and both parties.
Obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity. He believes in Government.
Economic growth can save Social Security, Medicare and America.
Reporters say it's the Trump Bump---I tell CNBC I am buying stocks--- and the market goes up.

If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas?

I am happy to see the majority of the GOP candidates agree with me that the tax code must be simplified and the rates dropped.
When will Washington stand up to China. China is manipulating its currency and stealing our jobs. Washington should move on legislation.
Why aren't we getting any oil from Iraq before we leave? We are leaving the country wide open for Iran. Big mistake.
The Debt is our nation's greatest threat. @BarackObama is out of touch.
When will our nation's sacrifices  be respectfully appreciated? Iraq and Libya should reimburse us in oil.
Our worst threat to unemployment is @ObamaCare.  It will also destroy our country's basic standards.
The US Air Force won the war in Libya to clear the way for Islamic Extremist control of Libya.

THe Chinese military is already hacking our satellites http://t.co/SeQio55u.   The Chinese government is not an American ally.
The Republicans never should have agreed to this past summer's debt deal.  Military cuts will now come along with tax increases.
Another company that the DOE has given money to just filed for bankruptcy. This is how the money we borrow at 40% from China is wasted.
The  @SuperCommittee must cut spending, not raise taxes. Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem.
Why is @BarackObama letting the Taliban know when our troops are leaving? http://t.co/V1CrdfCb  This is dangerous for our soldiers.
Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood just made its first visit to Hamas-led Gaza. Why did @BarackObama promote the "Arab Spring"?
The greatest threat to our security is our debt. It is already past 100% GDP. We need to make real budget cuts.

I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President.
Of course @hardball_chris attacked 'birthers' in praising @CondoleezzaRice's speech. Chris has completely lost it.

We fight to free Libya and they kill our Ambassador and other Americans. Obama's foreign policy is a joke.

I always said the people we fought for in Libya were bad news. Once again, I was right.
Libya is selling its oil to China--I notice the Chinese Ambassador is very safe.
Obama is a disaster at foreign policy. Never had the experience or knowledge. He is not capable of doing the job.
It's Wednesday, how many more of our embassies will be stormed by Islamists?

"Those who refuse to draw red line to Iran don't have the moral right to put a red line to @Israel." -- @IsraeliPM @netanyahu

Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally. They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak.
Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11?
With allies like Egypt and Libya, who needs enemies?!
What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies.
The media is pathetic. Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney.
I will be speaking Monday, September 24,\n (10 A.M.) at Liberty University, to a record setting student body. I look forward to it!
Why are we still giving billions of dollars we don't have in foreign aid to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt?
Obama's convention bounce is gone. @MittRomney has retaken the lead in the latest @RasmussenPoll  http://t.co/yOw3U3ja

The majority of Americans agree with @MittRomney's comments on @Israel and Iran.
It's Tuesday. How many more non-stories will the liberal media try to manufacture so everyone ignores Obama's record?
None of Romney's leaked comments change the fact that Obama is a complete disaster. 20% real unemployment and $6T in deficit spending.
Liberal press won't look into why Obama ignored security warnings for embassies but is obsessed with Romney's private comments.

The Republican Party must spend its money wisely and do incredible television commercials. They must be tough and smart.
With all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy, Obama should be down by 12 points--and he's not.
The Emmys were horrendous...the absolute worst show!
"Amazing Race" winning an Emmy again is a total joke. The Emmys have no credibility--no wonder the ratings are at record lows.

Despite all of China's cheating, they are not doing that well--we can beat them--our country has great potential!
The attack on our Libyan consulate was the worst attack on the US since 9/11. Time for Obama to come clean.

@escobedoantonio Thank you
I'm always amazed when I travel to my foreign properties.Seeing the Trump brand across 4 continents proves that excellence can be universal.

At the request of many- I will be doing live tweets during the next presidential debate.
Congratulations to @drewbrees on setting the @NFL record with 48 consecutive games with a TD pass. He is a great guy and player.
Obama projected a 2012 budget deficit of $557B.  It is actually double that at $1.1T http://t.co/QR8vZIcP  We can't afford four more years.
Sleepy eyes @chucktodd -- whenever you mention me unfairly I will likewise mention you.
Our many loyal viewers should expect a major announcement very soon on next season's @CelebApprentice. Our fans will be pleased.
.@carlosbeltran15 is playing great for St. Louis Cardinals. They made a wise decision.
.@ErraticSLK  Shout out = work hard!
Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices?
Drop A-Rod in the order and cut his salary based on unreported drug use. Also, not a pressure player.
In the end, Andy Pettitte did not rat out his friend Roger Clemens. I like him again, a lot.
George Will is a political moron. Last month he said Romney couldn't win.

"I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. On this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin." -- Mitt
I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod.
"It doesn't matter who you vote for--it matters who is counting the votes." Be careful of voter fraud!
27 days until America's greatest test since our founding. In this election, we decide whether we become great again.
I just had to fire someone, he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night.
47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.
Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @LibertyU students for my convocation speech. The honor was all mine!  Great people.
A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win. He simply can't perform without drugs.
I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama. Be careful on Thursday night!
Even with lower profit projections, American firms are still throwing money into China http://t.co/xRJlsxqB  Obama is killing investment.

Great move to take A-Rod out of game. Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs).
Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal
Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it "mildly" -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter.
.@Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the @todayshow with @MLauer
$30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)
Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.
Outright disgusting--the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb. Sean Smith's mother http://t.co/Gfppvzc2
How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?!

Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.
Get ready- this should be informative and fun! #VPDebate
Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate
Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate
Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate
Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate
Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate
Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate
Going over to @TodayShow now to introduce @ApprenticeNBC cast etc.-- watch.
British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted &amp; environment destroying Scottish windmills.
"Wing bangers"-- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U.S.
ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. Terrible.
Doing the @todayshow with @MLauer was great- I really like Matt.
I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on--they always win when I am there.
.@dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act.
Great to hear that our loyal @CelebApprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast. This will be something special!
With our amazing All Star cast, @Joan_Rivers, @johnrich, @ArsenioOFFICIAL &amp; @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors.
Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected.
"What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy." --@PaulRyanVP
When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them. Loyalty is very important.
I told you, whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win.
When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say " what were we doing".
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win.
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.
They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer.
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason. 
Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late.
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion.
Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.
A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave.
No, I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go, they win.
I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing.
A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.
Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.
Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt's doing well.
A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. He is a $30M/yr rip off.
Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us.

I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We'll all be watching @MittRomney.
I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers.
Verlander is great but  very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games
.@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right, it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected.
I can confirm the reports--@BillRancic, my first season winner, will be returning to this All-Star season of @CelebApprentice.
Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit, I wish the stuff worked.
Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent.
It's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings. And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks!
The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage.
Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real.
.@History's wonderful "The Men Who Built America" with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing, I'll be live tweeting the debate
.@antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep.
.@reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves.
Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice.
Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.
.@MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records &amp; transcripts--he will quiet down quickly.
If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. And I will go to games 6&amp; 7 so they will win!
For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?
@drumline_mormon  It is selling great at Macy's--thanks!
We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would.
I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice compliment--I agree.
Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say "let's get ready to rumble"!
Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.
Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp.
Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez 4 years.
.@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer.
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows. 
George Will said "best debate he ever saw". If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting.
Verlander pitched great, but @Yankees look truly defeated.
I still love Derek, he is a winner!
Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period!
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't!
Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him!
@marileenelson Thanks
Really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay. I am a long time Yankee fan.
Great article on wind turbines by Robert Bryce in today's @NYPost  http://t.co/9sL1WhVF
Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances &amp; environment of many countries &amp; communities.
Remember, new "environment friendly"  lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care.
Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines &amp; how destructive they are. Windmills are a disaster.
If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally &amp; aesthetically.
All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board.  Mitt will remember the early helpers.
Obama was beaten but not knocked out.  He lives to fight another day. But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance...
...Bad decisions can be devastating.
Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it, especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary
Last Saturday A-Rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded. But he was still hitting on girls from the dugout  http://t.co/ocd4ZHlD He is very selfish!
While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished, they won't quit for CC
Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters, even A-Rod, they got you there.
@BillRancic  Bill- You should have named your beautiful son Donald.
Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles.
Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. See what happens when I am not mentioned.
Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog &amp; will do it again--just watch. He can do much better!
Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?
What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all. We should be given credit for taking this risk.

Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism. We lose nothing to try.
Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans!
I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy.
My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick --very thrilling.
.@Toure I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @PiersMorgan. He drove you insane but, of course, Piers is a lot smarter than you
The brass in #TRUMP Tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. I keep the atrium impeccable. Key to its success!
Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. He wants Libya and China off the table.
"This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility." Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal.
Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert.
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see!
I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs.
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
Former Obama White House economic adviser @Austan_Goolsbee gave his old boss a 'C' on the economy http://t.co/6rzfGjMM  Pretty generous!
Well this is it, the final debate- let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live.
Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly.
.@MittRomney looks much calmer, and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward.
Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate
I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30.
Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down.
70% of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago http://t.co/pVppYf8l  At least someone has done well under Obama.
I always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. By stopping, he gave his enemies an opening.
No matter what happens in the election, @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit. He has kept Obama in it, even with his terrible record.

My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing last night’s presidential debate, my stock picks and tomorrow’s big announcement http://t.co/JwUXpmeP
Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden’s killing, not the President.
China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own!
My announcement is tomorrow!
Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit!
Last night was the first time Obama said "we" instead of "I" in respect to Bin Laden's killing.
.@bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night. I only wish Mitt was more aggressive!

Letterman @Late_Show was great last night. I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity.
Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins
....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause.
.@SabrinaSiddiqui  Re: Taylor and Conor--great news for Taylor!

By the way, where is @Oprah? Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway, who cares, I adore Oprah.

I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.
I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request, I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement.
Alert...The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked  in Benghazi. He did nothing...he is no leader.
@BernardMcGuirk. That's more than O'Reilly did ...and he is supposed to be my friend. You're terrific!
@johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy. But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy. Fight on John!
A lot changed when David Letterman said " he was probably born in this country"--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama.

So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY, not nearly as bad as stated on news. Let's see what happens later.
We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium--they are seeking refuge. Free coffee and food.
If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower, call office.
All weights are on crane's wrong side ---  very precarious below, move out!
The water damage to NYC is amazing. The winds were bad but the water was worse.
I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm.
Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don't fall for it.
Because of the hurricane, I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday.
Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states.
Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more!
The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place &amp; kept thousands of people warm &amp; safe during the storm--thanks, staff!
So many incredible friends said thanks for TT help --- I say thanks to you! http://t.co/0tf8Pm0n
The election is trending towards @MittRomney. Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline.

Let’s be honest, if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in Ohio on Monday.
Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5.  Taylor is terrific!
Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?
Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm?
China’s stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses http://t.co/LfATjhuf Their market gains the day we are hit by storm

.@antbaxter—Your documentary works better than any sleeping pill—in fact that may be your only way to make money with this recycled garbage!
.@antbaxter—Heard your documentary cost you less than $3,000 to make—where did you get that kind of money?
.@antbaxter Dummy,thanks for increasing awareness of my big golf project in Aberdeen—sales are thru the roof &amp; Aberdeen seeing big benefits.

A horrible day for Newtown, CT and our country yesterday. My condolences to all of the families so tragically affected.
In moments like this,we are all just Americans. I join with the President, religious and civic leaders and encourage all to pray today.
President Obama spoke for me and every American in his remarks in #Newtown Connecticut.
I find the photos of these children killed in Newtown in the New York Post heartbreaking.#Angels
In light of Newtown, our country has to pull together.
The tragedy in Newtown really makes you understand how life is so fragile. Must appreciate every minute!

Bret had a target on his back from the get go...
Trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $.  Looks like a good season for charities.
Omarosa always promises and delivers high drama...
Firing Bret was a tough one for me-but Omarosa doesn't seem to mind.
Will Plan B miss Trace?
Will Team Power be able to withstand Omarosa as PM? Smooth sailing is not expected.
My 757 is incredible-I think the teams agree on that.
Which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment?
Honest Omarosa: she won't backstab-she'll come at you from the front.
Trace delivers check to hospital in NYC:  American Red Cross must be grateful to Trace and his team for their tremendous work.
What do you think of Gary's definition of    f-u-n?
What?!  LaToya is saying Omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met?
Next she says she's being set up by Omarosa to fail....is somebody confused?
Omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept &amp; presentation.
Does anyone agree with Marilu that Gary, while 'adorable', is a distraction?

Business is easy. Dealing with people is hard. If you are an entrepreneur, your most important job is to choose who works with you.
It is terrible that neither Obama, Biden nor Kerry attended Lady Thatcher’s funeral. They would all run to Muslim Brotherhood Morsi’s.

When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals, remember the killings-maimings
Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away?  We are not dealing with an innocent baby here-DEATH
You are right, the media is always offending Donald Trump-they have no limits-but they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer!
"@ajbarker50: @realDonaldTrump do you try to make everything about you?"  YES!
NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards!
If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand!
Great sportscaster Al Michaels, a friend of mine, played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National, LA. He was in perfect shape!
I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning.
Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. Once he is well he will say, "speak to my lawyers."
.@bretmichaels and George Ross are back as advisors. Good to see them! #CelebApprentice

When it comes to violent crime, and if we are going to solve the problem, we must stop being so politically correct-must tell it like it is!
Likewise, the primary victims of violent crimes are in the African American and Hispanic communities. These people want LAW AND ORDER now!

I wonder what the great generals like Patton, the big M, or Robert E. LEE would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack?
If we are going to continue to be stupid and go into Syria (watch Russia), as they say in the movies, SHOOT FIRST AND TALK LATER!
Let the Arab League take care of Syria. Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack?

Who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes. Call it the "PLENTY OF NOTICE WAR"
Obama now just wants to save face, Russia is now telling him "don't do it". He waited too long and the other side is much better prepared.

Knockout assaults are the new rage by sick and depraved youth. We better start getting tough in this country-and they want to take our guns!
If you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged, and you carry a gun, shoot the bastard (teach them a lesson)!
Weak newscasters are asking "is there a racial component to knockout attacks?" Of course there is and weakness will only make it worse!
For all those sick degenerates contemplating a knockout attack, please remember the late, great Charles Bronson-no more crime!
If JP Morgan took their case through the courts for 15 years, nobody would be suing them—easy target.

How much longer are we expected to put up with the world's most incompetent     leader - ObamaCare, Iran, Syria, bads deals. JUST NEVER ENDS
We had all the leverage in our nuclear negotiations with Iran and our leaders foolishly decided to let them out of the trap. WHY?
Tom Brady has done a great job tonight-amazing New England comeback. Good game- not over yet!
Tom Brady is a good friend of mine, a great player, a great guy and a total winner! Fantastic comeback win-this is what our country needs!
John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran. Great dealmakers do not celebrate deals,they just go on to the next one
The reason great dealmakers do not OPENLY celebrate a deal, especially one that is not complete, is that it shows weakness to the other side
I know it has been many years since our country made great deals, but isn't it about time we start, right now. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Best book ever on dealmaking (or so they say) - TRUMP: THE ART OF THE DEAL.  Go get it, and others, Washington - you really can do better!
Don't underestimate yourself or your possibilities--keep your focus intact, and focus on the positives.
Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. You're in charge. Everything starts with you.
Obama is going to take away over 90M Americans’ healthcare plans but he is letting Iran keep its nukes. Just think about that.
Why didn't Obama, as part of the negotiation, free the Christian Pastor Saeed Abedini?  http://t.co/NRQHoDBwA0

Set the example. You can motivate others as well as yourself by remembering that you are setting the example.
Look at the solution, not the problem. Learn to focus on what will give results.
President Obama said, over and over again, if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, PERIOD! This turned out to be a total lie-90 mill.

US froze $8B in Iranian assets during ’79 Hostage Crisis. Now Obama is giving it back to Iran while Christian Pastor is jailed. Don't do it!
Why doesn't President Obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie, announce that ObamaCare was a mistake, and deal a really great plan!
Despite the fact that I have had great success with the words YOU'RE FIRED, I do not like firing people. But ZERO on ObamaCare mess-no way!

My complaint against @AGSchneiderman is a “case study” for JCOPE &amp; Moreland Commissions on everything that is wrong with NYS politics.
Sources inside @AGSchneiderman’s office are saying that they are very concerned with the allegations against their lightweight boss.
Bird killing windfarm that I oppose in Aberdeen got delayed by at least two years.@AlexSalmond forced the failing developers to delay!
If Graydon Carter's very dumb bosses would fire him for his terrible circulation numbers at failing Vanity Fair-his bad food restaurants die
The ill-conceived windfarm that @AlexSalmond is pushing for Aberdeen will lose $50 million a year. Only a fool would build it or want it!
Now Sebelius is “'urging' insurers to cover people who haven't paid” http://t.co/tdZnSWiJHf  Complete mess. Enrollment Numbers are a sham.

@PolitiFact’s #LieOfTheYear is Obama’s if you like your health care plan, you can keep it. Wrong. It’s the lie of the decade.
The evidence continues to mount against lightweight @AGSchneiderman.  It is time for JCOPE and Moreland Commissions to act.

#1. Keep the big picture in mind. There are always opportunities and possibilities, and thinking too small can negate a lot of them.
#2.  Keep your momentum. Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere.
#3.  Look at the solution, not the problem. Learn to focus on what will give results.

Ask yourself, "Is this a blip or is it a catastrophe?" and your equilibrium will be kept in check if/when hard times hit.

Resilience is part of the survival of the fittest formula--make sure you remain adaptable.
#1 for success: Find out what you love to do. Trust yourself enough to find out what is best for you and what you're best at doing...
For great success, you need passion, but make sure it's well directed. Learn everything you can about what you're doing. Be an expert.
Think positively. Zap negativity immediately. Focus on the solution, not the problem. Be persistent and alert--every single day. Momentum!

Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity. Obama, on the other hand, has fallen to his lowest ever numbers. SAD
I believe Putin will continue to re-build the Russian Empire. He has zero respect for Obama or the U.S.!
We should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever. Must be very strong to prosper &amp; survive
The situation with Russia is much more dangerous than most people may think - and could lead to World War III. WE NEED GREAT LEADERSHIP FAST
Obama must now FOCUS, get his mind off "March.Madness", and LEAD! Watch Russia closely, work hard on the economy and get rid of ObamaCare!

"Wow, did you see how badly @CNN (Clinton News Network) is doing in the ratings. With people like @donlemon, who could expect any more?"
"Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying "sources said," DO NOT believe it. There are no sources, they are just made up lies!"
"Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past, which is terrible!"
"Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT! Hillary was set up by a con."
"Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?"
"Remember, don't believe "sources said" by the VERY dishonest media. If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist."
"The people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the Dallas &amp; Arizona papers &amp; now USA Today will lose readers! The people get it!"
"Why isn't Hillary 50 points ahead? Maybe it's the email scandal, policies that spread ISIS, or calling millions of Americans deplorables! https://t.co/cvaMSAnAnE"
"For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o'clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!"

"I won the debate if you decide without watching the totally one-sided "spin" that followed. This despite the really bad microphone."
"The so-called Commission on Presidential Debates admitted to us that the DJT audio &amp; sound level was very bad. So why didn't they fix it?"
"Wow, just saw the really bad @CNN ratings. People don't want to watch bad product that only builds up Crooked Hillary."
"Heading to Pennsylvania for a big rally tonight. We will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"I know our complex tax laws better than anyone who has ever run for president and am the only one who can fix them. #failing@nytimes"
"I have created tens of thousands of jobs and will bring back great American prosperity. Hillary has only created jobs at the FBI and DOJ!"
""@trumplican2016: .@realDonaldTrump  There will be MASSIVE turnout for you,  Mr. Trump - These polls don't register the pulse of the PEOPLE!"
"Bernie should pull his endorsement of Crooked Hillary after she decieved him and then attacked him and his supporters."
"Melania and I extend our warmest greetings to those observing Rosh Hashanah here in the United States, in Israel, and around the world."
"Just announced that Iraq (U.S.) is preparing for battle to reclaim Mosul. Why do they have to announce this? Makes mission much harder!"
